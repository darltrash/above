Hello everyone! This is a guide for contributors 
to write their own translations!

Each translation is a single lua file which 
contains a set of strings and other thingies

To get started, you need to know your iso639-1
language code, which you can get from here:
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

Now you'll create a copy of the en.lua file
stored in this same folder, then translate each 
string's contents, NOT THE NAMES.

Then you'll rename it to your output two-letter
language code, for example:
- en.lua for english
- es.lua for spanish
- ... and so on!

Then you can just send me a PR with your 
translation to my repository here as a file in 
the language folder:
https://github.com/darltrash/above

Ooooor, you can store it in the game's folder as
a file like "language_<CODE>.lua", and the game 
engine should be able to load it as normal :)

(This means you dont need to download the source
code or have a debug binary, but instead just a
regular ol' release binary)

Thanks for reading!
