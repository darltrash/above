- Why Lua?
    Because it's a language that I feel like I "dominate", and I have
    a lot of experience with LÃ¶ve and LuaJIT

- Why .EXM for models? Why not any other format?
    Because all other formats posed too much complexity or weren't 
    efficient enough.

    OBJ is too naive and it's not a binary format, GLTF is far too
    complex and has a lot of features I won't use, etc.

    Plus, I'm friends with the developer of .EXM and he gave me all 
    his tooling for it.

- Why not pixel art? Isn't drawing a quad far more efficient?
    It IS more efficient, but it also just looks worse and I'm 
    honestly way too tired of pixel art.

    Plus, it isn't efficient enough to make a difference :P 

- Why TOML?
    Because it's readable and understandable, I used my own format
    before but I decided to use TOML instead because it actually had
    a proper VSCode extension (plus support for many other editors)
