sometimes i feel like my art does not live to my expectations, 
that this creative desire of mine just keeps deviating from what
i wanted,

everything is so insanely stressful, i dont even know what to do anymore
i feel as if i lack something, or as if my blood was turning into molasses
i dont need this anymore, i want to scream.
